section  general
# In this section you specify setting every router (Spine and Leaves get)
# As well as some global paramaters.
#
# organisation    : The name of the organisation to display in login message
# hostname-prefix : A hostname gets this and then spines S1..XX Leaves L1..Y
# p2p-range       : Network rang to set point-to-point in. from x.x.0.1 to x.x.4.254
#                 : with /30 ranges
# loopback-range  : Class C range for /32 IP's on loop loopback
#                   Spines go first first spine gets 1 etc. First leave gets 1+max-Spines
# nameserver      : Dns server, multiple allowed. Optional.
# ntpserver       : ntp server name or address, multiple allowed. Optional
# snmp-community  : Community getting read-only permision. Optional
# snmp-trap-server: Trapserver, optional
# syslog          : specify <IP> <facility> <level>
# leaves          : Number of leave switches in the fabric
# spines          : Number of present spine switches in the fabric
# max-spines      : Number of maximum spines the fabric can grow to
#                   max-spines must be greater or equal to number of Spines
#                   max-spine is used as offset in IP address calculation
#                   should typically be four or six
# max-Leaves      : Maximum number of leaves to support within ip numbering schema
#                 : In principle an ip-fabric always can scale more, but then the IP numbering gets disorganized.
#                 : A practical limit is also the number of interfaces on the spines ....
# spine-start-int : First interface to use on spine for leave connection
# leave-start-int : Guess
# mtu			        : mtu size on Spine-leave connections
#
# set             : all lines in inputfile beginning wit "set" will be copied to all config files
